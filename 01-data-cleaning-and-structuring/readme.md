# ðŸ§¹ 01 â€“ Data Cleaning and Structuring

This folder contains tasks that involve basic data cleaning and structuring using Python.

Each task is based on a question and involves simple steps like:

- Cleaning raw data  
- Organizing it into a structured format
- Printing the desired output  

These tasks are part of my ongoing Data Science practice.
